GUSTO is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for energy system modeling. Thanks to the open-source energy system modeling community it is an extension of the existing open-source model (OSM) [urbs](https://github.com/tum-ens/urbs)[[1]](#1).

## Further developments of the modeling framework:
- Extending investment costs by capacity-independent connection costs for network-based technologies
- Weighting of modeled time-steps (as an example to consider time step frequency)
- Different operational strategies of storage technologies
- Clustering algorithm for characteristic week representation to reduce simulation running time[[2]](#2).
